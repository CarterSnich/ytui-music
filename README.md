# Ytui-music
A test attempt to bring youtube (only audio [not youtube music]) to tui

## Current Status
The binary can do following for now:
* Search for youtube playlist, channel and videos
* Play the selection from music list
* Paging of result
* See trending music
* See playlist and videos uploaded in a channel
* See items included in playlist
This implies that project a bit behind from usable state. However all the base for implementing future goals have been pretty much complete.
I would love to see you implement those

## About Project
I listen to music a lot and youtube music is currently not available in my country (Nepal :love:) and even If it was available I prefer not to give
a tab of my browser to just listen music. Additionaly, I love to stay in terminal.
This was when I thought to build one. which I thought would be one of another small project while I learn rust and programming in general.
